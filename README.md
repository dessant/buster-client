## Description

Buster Client is a native app used by the [Buster](https://github.com/dessant/buster)
extension for user input simulation.

## Installation

The [Buster browser extension](https://github.com/dessant/buster) requires the Buster Client app to be installed in order to function. You can download [the latest binaries here](https://github.com/dessant/buster-client/releases).

### Installation on Windows

Run the `.exe` installer and follow the onscreen instructions from the browser window that appears.

### Installation on MacOS and Linux

To install the client in MacOS and Linux, you will need to mark the downloaded binary as executable, then run the binary in your preferred terminal client. 

```sh
# 1. make file executable
chmod +x buster-client-setup-*
# 2. run installer
./buster-client-setup-*
```

A new browser window will guide you through the rest of the install process.

## Issues
